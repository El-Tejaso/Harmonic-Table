# Harmonic Table

A virtual instrument made for touch screen devices created in Unity3D that is based on the Harmonic Table
note layout. The APK can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Harmonic-Table/releases/tag/V0.1.35).

Midi files can also be played. Notes that are going to be played are shown in realtime, and can be used to potentially teach yourself the instrument. 


#### Caveats:
Teaching myself an instrument that I didn't need to buy and maintain was initially the reason why I made this program, but learning this instrument still seems somewhat impossible, so I'm stopping development for now. More testing is required
