# Harmonic Table

A virtual instrument made for touch screen devices created in Unity3D that is based on the Harmonic Table
note layout. The APK can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Harmonic-Table/releases/tag/V0.1.35).

MIDI files can also be played. Notes that are going to be played are shown in realtime, and can be used to potentially teach yourself the instrument. 
(Credit goes to NAudio's [MIDI namespace](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio/tree/master/NAudio/Midi) for doing all MIDI parsing in this project).


#### Caveats:
Teaching myself an instrument that I didn't need to buy and maintain was initially the reason why I made this program, but learning it seems somewhat impossible, so I'm stopping development for now. More testing is required
