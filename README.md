# Harmonic Table

A virtual instrument created in unity that is based on the Harmonic Table
note layout made for touch screen devices.

Midi files can also be played. Notes that are going to be played are shown in realtime, and can be used to potentially teach yourself the instrument. 


#### Caveats:
Teaching myself an instrument that I didn't need to buy and maintain was initially the reason why I made this program, but learning this instrument still seems somewhat impossible, so I'm stopping development for now. More testing is required
